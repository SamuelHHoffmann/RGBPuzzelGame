# RGBA : A Color Puzzle Game

## About: 

RGBA is a 2D puzzle game based around the main computer color scale of red, green, blue, and alpha (transparency). While computers use this to represent color making your phone more pretty, RGBA uses it to frustrate you as you desperately try to get your player to end of each puzzle. Keeping this in mind, players must turn on or off color channels so they have a path to get from the start of the level to end. Pretty straightforward, right?

## Why?

`Why make your app public for anyone to download on Github? `

Simply I needed to publicly host support documentation and a privacy policy and thought to put it here with the code. However, before that the app was public for job searching purposes. I recently graduated from university and am looking for a full time software development job. I do a lot of private programming simply for myself and because of that someone thinking about hiring me might not be able to see what I do. By making my game public, prospective employers can see my programming by both playing the game or taking a look at my source code.

`Why RGBA?`

My previous project was Ticket Tap, and while Ticket Tap is fun and definitely has room to improve with more features, I had recently played  [.projekt](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/projekt/id1244456273) a simple, yet artistic and fun puzzle game and wanted to try and make a puzzle game myself. Knowing that I wanted to create a puzzle game and that I wanted it to be fairly simple yet still have a bit of complexity to it, I brainstormed for a while about game ideas and came up with this.

`Sweet project, can we talk?`
